This file contains board-specific information for the CPV5300
target board.  This file describes the method for generating the full
product documentation, and informs the user of serious caveats, if any,
that must be noted before using this BSP.  Additionally, the target
board's Hardware Reference Manuals and Installation Manual provide 
board-specific information necessary to run VxWorks.  The target's
hardware documentation should be read fully before this BSP is used.

RELEASE 1.2/2
	This is the T2.2 release.  The special fei82557End.obj and special
	smUtilLib.obj objects are no longer required and have been replaced.
	Default console is the serial port, not the video/keyboard.
	New variables in sysALib.c: sysCsSuper, sysCsExc,
	sysCsInt.  New CPUID structure.  Modified rtns sysCpuProbe(),
	sysIntEoiGet(), new file loApicIntr.c Removed ATA, LPT, and SLIP
	drivers from default configuration to trim size of bootrom images.

RELEASE 1.2/1:
	This is the second FCS release for Tornado 2.0.  Changes are primarily
	cosmetic and  do not change functional behaviour.  The cpv5300 is
	the base BSP for all the cpv5xxx BSPs. The cpv5000, cpv5350, and
	cpn5360 now share many files with this BSP.

RELEASE 1.2/0:
	This is the first release for Tornado 2.0.
