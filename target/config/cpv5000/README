This file contains board-specific information for the CPV5000
target board.  This file documents BSP interface changes from previous
software or hardware versions, and informs the user of serious caveats
that must be noted before using this BSP.  Additionally, the target
board's reference entry (e.g., man CPV5000 for UNIX or the HTML
reference entries) provides board-specific information necessary 
to run VxWorks.  The target reference entry should be read fully 
before this BSP is used.
