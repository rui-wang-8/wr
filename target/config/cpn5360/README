This file contains board-specific information for the CPN5360
target board.  This file describes the method for generating the full
product documentation, and informs the user of serious caveats, if any,
that must be noted before using this BSP.  Additionally, the target
board's reference entry (i.e. man CPN5360 for UNIX or the HTML
reference entries) provides board-specific information necessary 
to run VxWorks.  The target reference entry should be read fully 
before this BSP is used.
